Magic8Ball
==========

Magic 8 Ball is an app that mimics the behavior of a Magic 8 Ball toy.  The app will show a splash screen when the user first open the app. After 4 seconds, the instruction screen will appear and tell the user to face the device down and ask a question.  I used the message "I am ready to answer the question" as a alert to show that the device is in a screen pointing down stage. After that, the user can turn the device facing up to hear the answer.  The app will generate 20 random answers using text to speech. This app was made for Android device.
